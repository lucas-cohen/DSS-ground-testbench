# DSS-ground-testbench
A On ground Test Bench for Distributed Space System 

## About The Project
Distributed Space Systems (DSS) is a concept of utilizing multiple spacecraft to implement complicated
tasks linked with applications such as On-Orbit Servicing (OOS), debris removal, formation flying, etc.
The key challenge of DSS is the autonomous Guidance Navigation and Control. In TU Delft, a small
testbench for research and education of DSS is under development, based on multiple omnidirectional
vehicles.

The objectives of the project are
* Develop a two-vehicle testbench allowing autonomous patterned movement.
* Develop autonomous GNC algorithms that can drive the vehicle remotely from a laptop using
onboard sensors.

### Build with
The following key libraries and frameworks are required to be installed for the testbench to function.
* MotivePy


### Hardware
The project is build around the Nexus omnidirectional robot platform and the optitrack system with the following hardware.
* Arduino
* Wifi module
* OptiTrack system
